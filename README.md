Spotify Clone ðŸŽµ

Yo, welcome to my Spotify Clone! Itâ€™s a music app thatâ€™s almost as dope as Spotify, but with my own vibe. Think Google sign-in, slick design, and a backend thatâ€™s tougher than my old mixtapes.

Whatâ€™s Cool?
Sign in Quick: Google SSO via Clerkâ€”no password nonsense.
Smooth Moves: React Router for zipping around the app.
Looks Fire: Tailwind CSS makes it pop on any screen.
Backend Muscle: Express.js and MongoDB keep things tight.
No Crashes: Catches errors like I catch feels for a good beat.

Whatâ€™s It Made Of?
Frontend: React (TypeScript), Clerk, Axios, Tailwind CSS, Lucide icons, Vite (zooms like my old Walkman).
Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB with Mongoose.
Extras: CORS, dotenv, cloudinary..
